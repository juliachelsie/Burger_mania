Burger-Mania is a website for a restaurant in Gothenburg, Sweden. It will help customers to hopefully choose Burger-Mania for their next restaurant-visit. It targets hungry customers who want to eat something tasty and delicious, in the inner city of Gothenburg. urger-Mania is useful to customers because they can easily find the menu, they can read about the restaurant and how they only use local and organic products, book a table and find were the restaurant is located on a google map.

## Features left to implement
- I would like to add a funktion to make it possible for the user to create an acount and log in. I would also like to add a function to avoid double bookings.
  
## Design

- __Typography__
- Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:
- Road Rage is used for headings on the site, it is a sans-serif font.
  
- __Colour__
- I used this color scheme on the website. I think the palette goes well with the theme and gives a cool impression to the user.
